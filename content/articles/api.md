# API

## What is API

API stands for “Application Programming Interface.” To understand API better, let’s understand a analogy.

Let’s say you went to a restaurant. The waiter comes to you and gives you menu or tell you verbally. Either way you now have the necessary information about today menu. You have enough information to know, if you order something what you are going to get. Then you order something and after a while, the food comes. The interesting take from this analogy is that, after perceiving the menu and placing order and before getting the food, you don’t know what’s going on in the kitchen, how the cooks are preparing the food, what spices they are using. You don’t need to know the details to get the food. 

## The need for an API

This is more or less what API is. It’s not a new concept. We have been using API in our day to day life. From going to bank to deposit money to accessing Google Maps for longitude and latitude values. Any place where there is an application and we can access and get some functionality or data of that application without knowing anything about how the background task are running but knowing enough to order the information is an API call.

From a Developers perspective, an API makes the developers life a lot easier. Just think about what would happen if you were to build an android app and you have to put capturing photo functionality. Without the Camera API, you would have to write your own Camera Interface that talks with HW. Like this example, developers use API almost everyday of their life. API helps developer abstract business logic from the core functionality of an Application. It also prevents devs from reinventing the wheel.

## Communication between services

We often use ride sharing apps like uber or pathao. One key thing about these ride sharing apps is the map they use to pinpoint riders and customers location. Uber heavily uses google map service for their app. So, uber itself is a service and google maps is another service. These two services communicate between them through series of APIs that both establishes the accessibility and security for the app.

Like the above example, APIs are currently everywhere and it has made communication between services a lot easier making developer create apps and services that works wonder.
