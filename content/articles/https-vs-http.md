# HTTP VS HTTPS

## What is HTTP

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol it’s a prescribed order and syntax for representing information over a network. Most of the information that is sent over the internet whether website content or API calls use HTTP Protocol. So how does this protocol looks like? 

```
GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.63.0 libcurl/7.63.0 OpenSSL/1.1.l zlib/1.2.11
Host: www.example.com
Accept-Language: en

//snippet from cloudflare website
```

This text often generated by the user’s browser, gets sent across the Internet. But the main problem arises when confidential data such as passwords, credit card info or other sensitive data is sent using HTTP protocol because anyone monitoring the connection could easily intercept this piece of text and harm the user. This is a major security concern in modern web. To solve this problem we have HTTP with a S. 

## HTTPS

The “s” in HTTPS stands for secure. HTTPS uses TLS or SSL to encrypt the request and response so that the person who is monitoring the network sees something like this:

```

```

TLS uses public key encryption to ensure the validity of the user and the server using public and private keys.
