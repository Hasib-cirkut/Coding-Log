## Short Intro

### Hi 👋

My name is Hasibul Huda. I’m a Software Engineer Based out of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I’m currently working as Junior Software Engineer at [WellDev](https://welldev.io).

In my day to day life as Software Engineer I work primarily on Vue.js and Nuxt.js. As you would’ve guessed by now, I love working with JavaScript and it’s surroundings. I have sound knowledge of the language itself and popular frameworks such as React.js, Svelte.js and Vue.js. I also have working experience with meta framework such as Next.js and Nuxt.js.

Although I work mainly on the frontend side of things, I sometimes dabble with the backend also. Among my favourite backend technologies are Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js, Postgres, MongoDB and Prisma. I have also used handful of CMS such as Contentful and Strapi for my personal projects.

## Why I became Software Engineer

Growing up, video games always fascinated me. When I look back now, I realize that I was crazy about three things. Books, Games and Cricket. So, I always wondered how video games were made. That lead me to dig into something called ActionScript. It was the scripting language for Adobe Flash. Then in my undergraduate, I spent two years writing C and C++. Although never wrote anything noteworthy in C or C++, but I liked it. C in my opinion is the hidden powerhouse that made it possible to have things we have now. Literally every device we use today, every server runs C.

## Life philosophy

If you are here, then prepared to be bored!!. Just kidding. I’ll keep it short and simple.

I like to think myself as 70% spiritual and 30% materialistic person. I know these numbers doesn’t make any sense. But it’ll give you a nice mental image if you wanna imagine. As I am very much fond of art, music, films, I like to see through life a bit differently then others. I often think about life and our existence, what it’s means to be alive in this vast cosmos.

I believe everything you do has consequences. And you have to face it, embrace it and live through it.

## Goals, Wishes and Expectation

Although I grew up hugging the sea, I freaking love mountains. From time to time I wanna climb mountains. That’s it. I also wanna see Pink Floyd, Metallica, Damien Rice, Dream Theatre live. Maybe visit louvre someday or be amazed by the Sistine Chapel.
