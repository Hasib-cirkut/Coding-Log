## Short Intro

### Hi 👋

My name is Hasibul Huda. I’m a Software Engineer Based out of Dhaka, Bangladesh. 👨‍💻

I’m currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at [WellDev](https://welldev.io).

In my day to day life as a Software Engineer I work on Vue.js and Nuxt.js. As you would’ve guessed by now, I love working with JavaScript and its surroundings. I have sound knowledge of the language itself and popular frameworks such as React.js, Svelte.js and Vue.js. I also have working experience with meta frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt.js.

Although I work on the frontend side of things, I sometimes dabble with the backend also. Among my favorite backend technologies are Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js, Postgres, MongoDB and Prisma. I have also used a handful of CMS such as Contentful and Strapi for my personal projects.

## Why I became Software Engineer

Growing up, video games always fascinated me. When I look back now, I realize that I was crazy about three things. Books, Games and Cricket. So, game development has always amazed me. That led me to dig into something called ActionScript. It was the scripting language for Adobe Flash. Then in my undergraduate, I spent two years writing C and C++. Although I never wrote anything noteworthy in C or C++, I loved writing in it. So I focused on the development side of things. I learned node.js and used it for one of my varsity projects. Then I dived deep into the JS framework frenzy starting with React.js.

## Life philosophy

If you are here, then prepare to be bored!!. kidding. I’ll keep it short and simple.

I like to think of myself as 70% spiritual and 30% materialistic. I know these numbers don't make any sense. But it’ll give you a nice mental image if you wanna imagine. As I am very much fond of art, music and films, I see life differently than others. I often think about life and our existence, what it means to be alive in this vast cosmos.

It's my understanding that everything you do has consequences. And you have to face it, embrace it and live through it.

## Goals, Wishes and Expectation

I spent 18 years of my life beside the sea. But that didn’t stop me from loving the mountains. I have been to Keokaradong, Tajindong, Nafakhum, Shatbhaikhum and some other places in Bangladesh.

Music has a special place in my life. It shaped my life in a very meaningful way. I absolutely love and adore Pink Floyd. The transcendental timeless music of Pink Floyd has always mesmerised me. Apart from them, I love The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Tool. I grew up listening to Bangladeshi band music. Artcell, Warfaze, Meghdol and Karnival are some of my favorite bands from my country.

I’m also very fond of solo artists like Leonard Cohen, Damien Rice, Gregory Alan Isakov and Arnab.

I also like to take street photos with my phone. Here is my [Instagram public page](https://www.instagram.com/hasib.cirkut/) where you can find my recent photos.
